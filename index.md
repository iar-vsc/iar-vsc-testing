# IAR-VSC

Welcome to the `IAR-vsc` documentation. The `IAR-vsc` plugin makes it possible
to combine the IAR compiler solutions with Visual Studio Code. The goal is that
this plugin supports all compiler variants. So not only ARM or AVR, but also
STM8 and other compilers of IAR. The author of this extension only uses ARM, AVR
and STM8, but when users find issues for other IAR compilers, open an issue on
Github. In case you open an issue, please report the used compiler with its
version and if possible the ewp file.

The plugin can parse *ewp* files and convert them to a valid
`c_cpp_properties.json` configuration which is used by the *cpptools* extension
made by *Microsoft*.

See the [User Guide](user-guide) for how to use this plugin. If you would like
to contribute, please see the [Contribution guide](contributing).

The source of this project is hosted on [Github][github-repo].

If you find any issue or if you have a feature request, please submit it at
through [github issues][github-issues].
