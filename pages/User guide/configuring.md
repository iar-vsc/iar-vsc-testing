# Configuring

It is adviced to use the extension UI to configure the extension. The UI are statusbar items which will execute a command when clicking on them.

![Status bar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluyckx/iar-vsc/master/Extension/images/readme/statusbar.png)

You can also call the commands behind those buttons, see the `contribution` tab in the extension section of VS Code.

To configure your project, configure the following options:
* IAR workbench installation
* Compiler
* Project (ewp file)
* Configuration
