# Building

When you execute the VSCode command `Tasks: Configure Task` two items are added which are generated by this extension:

* `iar: IAR Build - template using selected workbench, project and config`
* `iar: IAR Rebuild - template using selected workbench, project and config`

When selecting one of the two, a default task is generated which uses the workbench, project and configuration selected using the UI. When you select a different configuration, project or workbench, this script will use the newly selected items.

## Deprecated Method: Create manually

In previous plugins there was a build command. However, from now on you can create a task because all necessary information is available through settings. You can use the following snippets to create a `build` and `rebuild` command. In alpha2 or beta1 will contain a `problem matcher`. Use the following template as a starting point:
```
{
    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "IAR Build",
            "type": "process",
            "command": "${config:iarvsc.workbench}\\common\\bin\\IarBuild.exe",
            "args": [
                "${config:iarvsc.ewp}",
                "-make",
                "${config:iarvsc.configuration}"
            ],
            "problemMatcher": [
                "$iar-cc",
                "$iar-linker"
            ],
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            }
        },
        {
            "label": "IAR Rebuild",
            "type": "process",
            "command": "${config:iarvsc.workbench}\\common\\bin\\IarBuild.exe",
            "args": [
                "${config:iarvsc.ewp}",
                "-build",
                "${config:iarvsc.configuration}"
            ],
            "problemMatcher": [
                "$iar-cc",
                "$iar-linker"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
